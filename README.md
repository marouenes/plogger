# Development comments

List of TODOs:

- [X] Fixed hierarchy depth = 1
- [X] Log to console
- [X] Log to json
- [X] Catch errors for handling
- [-] Use proper logging library for console output
- [ ] Only allow context to be used once!
- [X] Consider hierarchy when logging, list of names or use dot notation for names?
- [ ] get ok/error for the upper levels in the hierarchy automatically
- [ ] More error and info types that are better for logging data (number of datapoints, etc..)
- [ ] function decorator for context management. PDF generator superclass to not get messy dependencies?
- [ ] Get contextualized logger from pdf_context?
